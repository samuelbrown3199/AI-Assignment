When the program starts it will allow you to set a target framerate to run at.

If there are any maze files you want to test, add them to the release\mazes folder and then the program and find and read them. I found that ANSI is the best format to use.

When the window opens you can press:

M - to create maze and ai, this will prompt you what to do in the console window
N - delete a maze and ai.


There are different modes for the AIs:

Genetic modes:

0 = normal, no punishments
1 = wall punishment

When choosing your genetic settings i recommend the following:

8 Chromosomes
0.7 crossover rate
0.01 mutation chance

The gene count can be what ever you want, within reason for the AI to actually solve the maze.
